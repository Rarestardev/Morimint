## **Project Overview**
Mori Mint Clicker Game is an interactive mobile game where users collect virtual coins by completing tasks, inviting friends, and playing engaging jackpot and board games. These virtual coins, once listed on a cryptocurrency exchange, are distributed to users as an airdrop, which is then withdrawable. The game includes features like daily rewards, energy management, and character progression, enhancing user engagement.

### **3. Referral Program**
- Users can invite friends to the app, and both the referrer and the invitee earn rewards, fostering user growth and increasing the app’s reach.

### **4. Jackpot Game**
- A thrilling Jackpot game where users can spin for prizes. It uses a randomized point allocation system that adds excitement and unpredictability.

### **5. Energy Management**
- A dynamic energy system where users lose energy with each click but can refill it over time, with the addition of a Turbo mode to speed up the coin collection.

### **6. Character Progression**
- As users advance in levels, characters evolve and change, keeping the gameplay fresh and providing a sense of achievement.

### **7. Push Notifications**
- Integrated Firebase to send notifications about new tasks, rewards, and special events to keep users engaged and informed.

### **8. Secure & Fair Play**
